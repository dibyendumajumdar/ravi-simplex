luasimplex

1. What?

luasimplex is an implementation of the simplex method for solving linear
programming problems written in Lua.

2. Why?

It'd be nice if Rima had an LP solver that worked "out of the box" so you could
at least get started without having to download and build a real solver.

3. Requirements

Lua or LuaJIT, and, if you want to run the netlib tests, lfs and the netlib test
data.

4. Issues

Speed.  Numerical stability.

5. How?

Get luasimplex from github.
It looks like the easiest place to get the netlib test problems is here: http://www.numerical.rl.ac.uk/cute/netlib.html

Then:

    make
    cd lua
    lua[jit] test-netlib.lua --test-dir <where you put the netlib data> --fast

Options to try are `--no-ffi`, `--c-structs` and `--c` (which uses the c version).
